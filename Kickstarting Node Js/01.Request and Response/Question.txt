Deliverable:


Task:


1. As we return the responses to as 'Hello World' for url '/' and 'This is your pizza' for url '/pizza'.


2. Based on the url the user hits , I want you to return custom responses.

When url = /home , return response as 'Welcome home'

When url = /about, return response as 'Welcome to About Us'

When url =/node, return response as 'Welcome to my Node Js project'

When url is anything else expect '/home,/about,/node' return 'Page Not Found'.


3.The responses should appear on the webpage as an added html element.
