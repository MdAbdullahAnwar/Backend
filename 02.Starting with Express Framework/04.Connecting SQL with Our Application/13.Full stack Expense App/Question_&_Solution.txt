Question: What the hell are pure or static functions?When do we use it?


Soluion: Pure Function


A pure function is one that:

Takes something in (input)

Gives something out (output)

Doesn’t mess with anything else outside the function


Example:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}


Always gives the same result for the same input.

Doesn’t change any variable outside.


Not pure example:

let x = 10;
function addToX(num) {
  x += num; // changes x outside
}


This one changes something outside, so it’s not pure.

Static Function (simple meaning)

A static function belongs to the class itself, not to any object you make from it.
You can call it directly from the class — no need to create an object.

Example:

class MathHelper {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(MathHelper.add(2, 3)); // 5


You didn’t do new MathHelper() — you called it directly.
