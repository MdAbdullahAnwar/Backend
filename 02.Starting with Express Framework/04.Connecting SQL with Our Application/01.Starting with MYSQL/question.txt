Question Description

Now that you have a basic understanding of how SQL works and how it can store and manage your data, it’s time to take the next step—connecting your Express app to a MySQL database! This is an exciting part of the journey because once you connect your app to the database, you'll be able to store and manipulate real-time data, powering dynamic features for your application.



Question 1. What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling ?

Answer:
Vertical Scaling (SQL): Upgrading a single machine (adding more CPU, RAM,
or storage).

Horizontal Scaling (NoSQL): Adding more machines (servers) to distribute the
load.



Question 2. What are the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?

Answer:

SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases

● Think of SQL as an organized filing cabinet, where everything has a fixed place
(tables, rows, and columns).
● Best for structured data like customer orders or bank records.
● Uses a fixed schema, meaning the data must follow a strict format.
● Scales vertically (by making a single computer more powerful).
● Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.


NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases

● Think of NoSQL as a flexible notebook, where you can jot down anything
without strict rules.
● Great for data that changes frequently, like social media posts or real-time chat
messages.
● Uses a flexible schema, meaning data can be stored in various formats (JSON,
key-value pairs, etc.).
● Scales horizontally (by adding more computers to handle growth).
● Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

Note: Make sure to remember or securely save the root username and password, as you will need them for future access. Losing these credentials may prevent you from managing the database later.



Task 2: Connect Express App to MySQL Database



Watch this video links how to connect your Express app to MySQL database.


Note: Make sure to remember or securely save your root username and password. You will need them for future access, and losing them may prevent you from managing the database.



Additional Notes:

You will use SQL (MySQL) for your upcoming projects. Many companies prefer SQL databases due to their ability to handle structured data, complex queries, and transactions with great consistency.
