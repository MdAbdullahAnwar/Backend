Insert Introduction

Insert Implementation



Before attempting this question, watch the video on the INSERT statement in SQL. It demonstrates two approaches to adding data to a table:


With Column Names: Ensures clarity by specifying the target columns, reducing errors if the table structure changes.


Without Column Names: Adds values directly in the tableâ€™s column order but requires accuracy in matching the column sequence.



Deliverables:

Question:

We have a table employees. The employee has the following details:



id

name

age

department

salary



Write an SQL query to add a new employee to the employees table such that we are making the entries as



id :104

name : 'Michael Johnson'

age : 29

department :'Finance'

salary : 65000
