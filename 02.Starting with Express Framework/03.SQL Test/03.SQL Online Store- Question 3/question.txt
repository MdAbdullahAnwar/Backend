Online Store Database Management

Hey, you are the DB Manager for an online shopping platform. Your job is to manage and maintain the database that tracks all the key information about the storeâ€™s operations. Customers browse products, place orders, and purchase multiple items in a single order. The database stores all the necessary details to manage inventory, calculate total revenue, and track customer activities.




Tables :

1. Customers Table

Stores customer details like name, email, phone number, address, and registration date.

Structure: CustomerID|Name|Email|PhoneNumber|Address|RegisteredDate




2. Products Table

Stores product details like product name, category, price, and available stock.

Structure: ProductID|ProductName|Category|Price|Stock




3. Orders Table

Stores order information such as order date, customer ID, and total amount of the order.

Structure:OrderID|CustomerID|OrderDate|TotalAmount




4. OrderItems Table

Stores details about each product purchased in the orders, such as product ID, order ID, quantity, and price.

Structure:OrderItemID|OrderID|ProductID|Quantity|Price




Deliverable:

JOIN Query

As the DB Manager for the online store, you are tasked with retrieving order details along with the customer information. You need to display the OrderID, Customer Name, and TotalAmount from both the Orders and Customers tables.




Write an SQL query to get the order details, including the OrderID, Customer Name, and TotalAmount, by joining the Orders and Customers tables.
